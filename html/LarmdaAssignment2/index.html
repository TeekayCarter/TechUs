                <h1>Choose a Website Builder</h1>
                <p>There are plenty of options to choose from when deciding what type of software or platform to use when you're learning how to create a website. Plug "website builder" into Google and you'll see what we mean.
                </p>
    
                <p> As you vet what's out there, it's important to keep two things in mind: <span class="bold">ease of use and flexibility.</span> Not to mention the cost. </p>
    
                <p>When you're new to website creation, it's tempting to go with the first thing that catches your eye.
                    But challenge yourself to think in the long-term because you want to create morethan just a website. You want to create an online presence and experience for your intended audience i a way that's scalable over time..
